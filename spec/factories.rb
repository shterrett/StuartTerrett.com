In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Well, that's certainly good to know. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Talk about going nowhere fast. This should be interesting. Not if I weaken first. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'll be sure to note that in my log. Your shields were failing, sir. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. You enjoyed that. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy."

You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship.
