Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Damage report! The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir."
